    bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmicki/SteamDeckGyroDSU/master/pkg/update.sh)
    
Above command will download the binary package and install it. It can be also used to update to the newest version at any time.

### Remarks about update from version 1.*

Versions **1.\*** of **SteamDeckGyroDSU** required superuser access to be installed.

Versions **2.0** and above don't need it.

Still, after update from **1.\*** to **2.0** or higher, the changes done with superuser access will be left in the system.
Uninstall script will not remove them anymore since version **2.0**.

Reverting those changes is not necessary but can be done by executing following command (requires superuser access):

    $HOME/sdgyrodsu/v1cleanup.sh

after version **2.0** or above is installed.
